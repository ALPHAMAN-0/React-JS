# React JS

React JS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. Developed and maintained by Facebook, React allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.

## Key Features
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- **Declarative UI**: Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
- **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering and improve app performance.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows in one direction, making the app easier to debug and understand.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Supported by a large community, with many libraries and tools for routing, state management, and more.

## Getting Started
To start using React JS:
1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Create a new React app using Create React App:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   cd my-app
   npm start
   ```
3. Start building your components in the `src` folder.
